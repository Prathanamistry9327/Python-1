14. What are negative indexes and why are they used?
Ans:
    Indexing is a way of accessing individual items or elements of a sequence by their position or order within the sequence. 
For example, if you have a list of numbers, you can use indexing to get the first, second, third, or any other element of the list.
In Python, indexing starts from zero, which means that the first element of a sequence has an index of 0, the second element has an 
index of 1, and so on.

example:
        a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
        print(a[1])
        print(a[2]) 
        print(a[3]) 

-  You can use negative indexing in Python with any sequence type, such as lists, strings, tuples, or ranges. You can also use negative 
indexing with slicing, which is a way of getting a subsequence or a part of a sequence. Getting the last element of a sequence. You can 
use an index of -1 to get the last element of any sequence.
